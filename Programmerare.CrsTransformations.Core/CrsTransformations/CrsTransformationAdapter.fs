IMPORTANT NOTE:
There are THREE types in this file:
    - ICrsTransformationAdapter
    - CrsTransformationResult
    - CrsTransformationResultStatistic
(regarding the reason: read below)

The above three types in this file are separated with "and" 
( or actually the keyword "and" is used INSTEAD OF "type" 
for the second and third types in this file).
The reason for having these three types in the same file 
is that F# compiles files in a certain order which often 
is not a problem since you indeed usually want to 
avoid bidirectional dependencies. 
In this case I think it is reasonable/natural with some 
mutual dependencies between the three types in this file.
That is the reason for having put them here in the same file
i.e. having them here in the same file solves the problem 
by doing that and by using the keyword "and" between the types.
